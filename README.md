# Fashion Barbarian

Fashion Barbarian is a tiny Clojure API that currently only does one thing: returns up to 30 trendy fashion products from one of five randomly selected current trends. The products are pulled from the ShopStyle API. It's millennial pink pink because it's funny, and the grid is Masonry because it looks nice and I'm not too good at design. Hosted on Heroku for now.

The repo for the front end is [here](https://github.com/alexshook/fashion_barbarian_front_end), and you can view it in action [here](http://alexshook.com/fashion_barbarian_front_end/).
